### DATE: 11.10.23                                                                           
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221060278
### AIM: 
To find the sequence of plan for Monkey Banana problem using PDDL Editor.
###  Algorithm:
Step 1:  Start the program <br> 
Step 2 : Create a domain for Monkey Banana Problem. <br> 
Step 3:  Create a domain by specifying predicates. <br> 
Step 4: Specify the actions GOTO, CLIMB, PUSH-BOX, GET-KNIFE, GRAB-BANANAS in Monkey Banana problem.<br>  
Step 5:   Define a problem for Monkey Banana problem.<br> 
Step 6:  Obtain the plan for given problem.<br> 
Step 7: Stop the program.<br> 
### Program:
```
(define (domain monkey) 
 (:requirements :strips) 
 (:constants monkey box knife bananas glass waterfountain) 
 (:predicates (location ?x) 
 (on-floor) 
 (at ?m ?x) 
 (hasknife) 
 (onbox ?x) 
 (hasbananas) 
 (hasglass) 
 (haswater)) 
 ;; movement and climbing 
 (:action GO-TO 
 :parameters (?x ?y) 
 :precondition (and (location ?x) (location ?y) (on-floor) (at monkey ?y)) 
 :effect (and (at monkey ?x) (not (at monkey ?y)))) 
 (:action CLIMB 
 :parameters (?x) 
 :precondition (and (location ?x) (at box ?x) (at monkey ?x)) 
 :effect (and (onbox ?x) (not (on-floor)))) 
 (:action PUSH-BOX 
 :parameters (?x ?y) 
 :precondition (and (location ?x) (location ?y) (at box ?y) (at monkey ?y) 
 (on-floor)) 
 :effect (and (at monkey ?x) (not (at monkey ?y)) 
 (at box ?x) (not (at box ?y)))) 
 ;; getting bananas 
 (:action GET-KNIFE 
 :parameters (?y) 
 :precondition (and (location ?y) (at knife ?y) (at monkey ?y)) 
 :effect (and (hasknife) (not (at knife ?y)))) 
 (:action GRAB-BANANAS 
 :parameters (?y) 
 :precondition (and (location ?y) (hasknife) 
 (at bananas ?y) (onbox ?y))
:effect (hasbananas)) 
 ;; getting water 
 (:action PICKGLASS 
 :parameters (?y) 
 :precondition (and (location ?y) (at glass ?y) (at monkey ?y)) 
 :effect (and (hasglass) (not (at glass ?y)))) 
 (:action GETWATER 
 :parameters (?y) 
 :precondition (and (location ?y) (hasglass) 
 (at waterfountain ?y) 
 (at monkey ?y) 
 (onbox ?y)) 
 :effect (haswater)))
